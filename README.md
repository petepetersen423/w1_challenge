# Week 1 Challenge

Welcome to your first Challenge! Each module ends with a graded Challenge assignment, where you'll apply your new skills to a fintech problem. Challenges are designed to be complex, and you may need several hours to complete them. You can skip up to TWO Challenges in this course. The Challenge rubric, included in the Requirements section, contains more information about how this assignment is graded.
Background

You work for a lending startup engaged in microcredit loans. The company needs help valuing these loans. In this Challenge, you'll automate a process that does just that.
What You're Creating

Youâ€™ll create a Python program that automates the tasks associated with valuing microlending loans. Specifically, you'll do the following:

    Create a GitHub Repository

    Automate the Calculations

    Analyze Loan Data

    Perform Financial Calculations

    Conditionally Filter Lists of Loans

    Save the Results

You'll then upload your final code to GitHub.
